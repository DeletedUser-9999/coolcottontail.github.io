For young students, [bebras](https://www.bebras.org/) is a good way to learn computational thinking.   
[USA Computing Olympiad](https://usaco.org) and [Canadian Computing Competition](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html) are two major competition for high school students in USA and Cananda.

There are other prominent algorithmic programming contests, such as the [American Computer Science League](https://www.acsl.org/),  Topcoder, CodeForces, Google Code Jam and Google Kickstart.

[CyberPatriot](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/) and [picoCTF from CMU](https://picoctf.org/) are two national highly ranked coding competition focusing on computer security.


There are also several California (and online now) coding competitions, including [High School Programming Contest](https://www.cpp.edu/~hspc/), [Harker Programming Invitational](https://web.harker.org/programming/), [Girls Programming League (GPL)](https://www.girlsprogrammingleague.org/).

A list of coding competition is maintained [here](https://clist.by/).
